        <p>Blocbox wanted more than just a convenient online data storage when they came to me. They wanted to build their app around users. They wanted to make users be able to multi-task as well as create and store files, be able to comment and collaborate with their team all in one place without having the hassle of switching over to another tab, window, or app. They wanted to make sure that their clients gets what they need out of their service with pleasing to the eye design. And this is where I come in, my role as UX and UI Designer, to research, design, and build this app from scratch and to reach both my company’s goals as well as Blocbox’s potential users.</p>
